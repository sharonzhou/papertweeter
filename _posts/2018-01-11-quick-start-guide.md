Medical puzzle:

Take Black vs. White patients with similar knee x-rays

Why do Black patients have more pain?

Our paper in
@NatureMedicine
 provides one answer: https://go.nature.com/3i6zAuc

Algorithms see causes of knee pain in Black patients, that human radiologists miss.

A patient comes into your office with chronic pain. You send her for an x-ray to look for arthritis.

The report comes back: the knee “looks ok”

But what if the radiologist missed something?

What are radiologists looking for anyway?

What we know about arthritis on x-rays comes from studies like this one:

Coal miners and office workers in Manchester, ca 1950

(No need to comment on gender/ethnic breakdown of study population… when it’s all the same!)
