Excited to share our #ICLR2021 paper w/ CS & math depts @Stanford 🎊

Evaluating the Disentanglement of Deep Generative Models through Manifold Topology!

w/ @ericzelikman Fred Lu @AndrewYNg Gunnar Carlsson @StefanoErmon. Acknowledging @torbjornlundh Samuel Bengmark.

Thread 🧵

Before I start: camera-ready 📸 & math-inclined R5 burn 🔥 are here
openreview.net/forum?id=djwS0…

Huge appreciation for all reviewers esp R5 in making our work better.

My goal in 🧵: Explain our work in my simplest terms to you. Don't worry if you get lost, it's admittedly dense :)

Disentanglement in your generative model means dimensions in its latent space can change a corresponding feature in its data space, e.g. adapting just 1️⃣ dim can make the output "sunnier" ☁️→🌥→⛅️→🌤→☀️ Contrast w/ this entangled mess ☁️→🌥→🌩→🌪→☀️
